## Instructions 

  1. Download [ACL2s for Linux](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/update/pkgs/eclipse-acl2s-1.3.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)
  2. Follow [the instructions on the ACL2s Web
     page](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/#:~:text=Simply%20unpack%2Funzip%20(7z)%20the%20prepackaged%20Eclipse),
     beginning where the text ["Unpack .."
     begins](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/#:~:text=Simply%20unpack%2Funzip%20(7z)%20the%20prepackaged%20Eclipse). The
     one deviation from those instructions is that you have to install
     the two directories (eclipse and acl2s-for-eclipse) in the
     directory /opt/ (which you probably have to create).
