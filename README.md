# Dependencies


# Building 

To build this site locally, copy or clone this repository, and then
execute `jekyll build` from within the top directory. You may prefer
using `bundle`, that is `bundle exec jekyll build`. To run it locally,
use `jekyll serve` rather than `jekyll build`, as appropriate.

# New Posts

To create a new homework assignment, lab assignment, lecture, to add a
new person, or enrichment resource, enter the corresponding
sub-directory, and from there, create a new entry within `_posts`. The
existing entries should serve as models.
