As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. To help bridge the chasm, I will leverage some of the
technology platforms Northeastern makes available to us.

## [Duo 2FA](https://get2fa.northeastern.edu/)

Most if not all students will already have enrolled themselves for the
Duo 2FA system. It is essential that you do so to access
Northeastern's digital resources. Northeastern has at least two
tutorials for installing and using the Duo 2FA system:

   - [The express version](https://express.northeastern.edu/get2fa/how-to-enroll-in-2fa/)
   - [The ~servicenow~ guide, (with pictures)](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=436cd1dbdb808854c5575e38dc9619e3&sysparm_class_name=kb_knowledge)

## Piazza 

[Piazza.com](http://piazza.com/) hosts our main Q&A forum. We are everyone learning; no one
knows all the answers, and remember that everyone wears their best and
most knowledgeable face. For questions related to the course material,
assignments, policies, or what have you, please utilize Piazza. I
generally prefer anonymous Piazza posts over email---this way others
get the benefit of your thoughtful question and answers and
corrections scale to the size of our class. Please do anonymize them
if you wish; we can see even if you cannot. Frequently someone will
have the same concern or be feeling the same way.

 If it doesn't "give away the punchline" of some homework question or
 assignment, *necessitate* PII in the question or the answer, and isn't
 contrary to FERPA or your rights under the Northeastern University
 Handbook, please do consider if this can be a Piazza message.

## Khoury Account 

To access the following two resources, you will need your Khoury
systems account username and password to login and to register. Go
[here](https://my.khoury.northeastern.edu/forgot/username) to find it
if you have forgotten. If it turns out you do not have one, apply
[here](https://my.khoury.northeastern.edu/account/apply).

## [KCCS/CCIS/CCS Github](http://ccs.github.neu.edu)

I will be utilizing the school's Enterprise git at
[http://ccs.github.neu.edu]. You should have access to that with your
KCCS account. I will expect you to know how to access this, for your
own benefits and for coursework. If you are not familiar, please
consult the Khoury Systems group's [documentation and
walk-through](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012152).

## [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is)

[Register here](https://hypothes.is/signup) for Hypothes.is, the collaborative editing tool. I will
expect student to collaboratively edit and annotate certain notes and
documents. As you read complete the reading assignments, you will
often find areas that are less clear than others, or sub-optimally
ordered, or deficient in a variety of other ways.

Chrome users can download and install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek), if you
wish. Users of other browsers can [install the bookmarklet](https://web.hypothes.is/start/#chrome-missing:~:text=For%20any%20browser%2C%20drag%20this%20button,or%20right%2Dclick%2Fcontrol%2Dclick%20to%20bookmark%20the%20link.). I will link
all our ~.pdf~ documents via hypothesis. FYI, if you are on an Android
device, you can send any page to hypothesis via the [following app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navasgroup.annoteweb).

[https://hypothes.is/groups/97DiEo3n/fa20cs2800](https://hypothes.is/groups/97DiEo3n/fa20cs2800)

## Course Homepage

I constructed our course homepage as a Jekyll site built with Github
Pages. Student corrections and improvements are *incredibly* welcome!
You can submit a [pull request
(PR)](http://github.ccs.neu.edu/jhemann/21SP-CS2800) for a quick
correction and improvement. Every page on this website has a direct
links to its ~.md~ file in this repository.

## Canvas 

It is my intention to use Canvas solely as a shallow wrapper around
our course website.
      
## Handin Server

We will use the [Handin server](http://handins.ccs.neu.edu/) (bottlenose) to submit homework. You
will likely have experience with this platform from Fundies I; if you
do not, please read the [Handin Server Guide](http://ccs.neu.edu/home/blerner/handin-server/handin-server-guide.html). 

## PollEverywhere

As a part of a participation grade, I will be asking poll questions in
class (often several per class). These will constitute a part of your
grade. I will expect you to login to answer, during the class period
itself. You should ensure that you have added your northeastern
university email address account, and have this active and enabled.

You can use the web browser, the [desktop app](https://www.polleverywhere.com/desktop-beta), or the mobile app
[(Apple)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poll-everywhere/id893375312) [(Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polleverywhere.mobile&hl=en_US). Regardless of however you configure this, have it
with you and available at all times.

There is a [KB Article](https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article&sys_id=69a02a6fdb0d001084ba5595ce96199c) on logging in via Northeastern.

## Zoom 

I intend to broadcast our course meetings via [Northeastern Zoom](https://northeastern.zoom.us/). I
prefer it over MS Teams for a variety of reasons. Not the least of
which is the instantaneous and anonymous feedback that it provides,
via [Dial testing](http://dialsmith.com/blog/dial-tests-vs-focus-groups-how-are-they-different/). You will find it helpful to have two
internet-enabled devices with at hand when you are attending class
remotely, once for viewing the class and a second for answering poll
questions.

### Via direct installation. 

If you have difficulty installing or using the platform please see
ITS' associated [KB article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us) or contact [Zoom support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us).

### Via the browser

You also have the option to join without downloading or installing any
software, via the [Zoom web client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443-Zoom-web-client). The web client does not have all
the functionality of the desktop or mobile apps; please see the
comparison [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360027397692#query:~:text=Note%3A,-We). 

## NEU VPN 

Go to [http://vpn.northeastern.edu](http://vpn.northeastern.edu), and follow the instructions to
install the GlobalProctect VPN client on your machine. You will need
this to use the VDI linux machines. If you have difficulty please
consult the [relevant ITS KB articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=07d42f714f02cf0099c2fd511310c7b2), and if necessary [reach out to
ITS support](http://its.northeastern.edu/support/#et-boc:~:text=Still%20Need%20Support%3F).

## Eclipse & ACL2s

This semester we will use the [Khoury VDI](VDI_Linux_Machines) to use ACL2s in Eclipse. 

## VDI Linux Machines 

[Khoury VDI Virtual
Desktops](http://khoury.northeastern.edu/systems/vdi/), and the
[relevant ITS KB
articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=6b863d8d4f3b5b4450a5798e0210c735&kb_id=d82ad28c134922401528f5104244b068).

### Local Installation 

If you would like to work with ACL2s in a local installation, please
follow the installation instructions as part of the [first
lab](javascript:void(0)). You will know you have this installed
correctly if you can use [CodeTogether].

## Office hours

We'll be piloting the new [Khoury Office
Hours](http://info.khouryofficehours.com) system. You will find direct
links to these on our [Office Hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/office-hours/)
page. If you are new to this system, please see [the following
guide](https://www.notion.so/Office-Hours-Help-Guide-a89c73dd53204cc3970ac44d61917417)
for help.

## CodeTogether 

We will expect you to be able to share your screen with us (and one
another) via the CodeTogether platform. You can install it from [here](https://www.codetogether.com/download/drag-to-install/)
by following their instructions. If you have difficulty you can get
the best help from [CodeTogether chat](https://gitter.im/CodeTogether-com/community). 

## Applause!

One of the things I miss most about real, in-person classrooms is
being able to applaud someone for a job well done, and for getting up
and giving it a shot. Here's our [best
alternative](https://applause.haggett.org/21SP-CS2800). If each of us
goes here and enters his or her name then, when one of us presses the
applause button, we can all see and hear it.
