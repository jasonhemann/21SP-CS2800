title: How do I learn technical writing?
---

There are several places I suggest. The first of these I've already
listed [on the enrichment page and have discussed at length]({{
site.baseurl
}}/enrichment/#page-title:~:text=The%20Craft%20of%20Scientific%20Writing%20E).

I include here another that I have discussed and have even myself
found useful and consulted at times: [Ramsey's Tech Writing in
2hrs/week](https://web.archive.org/web/20120430215857/http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/pubs/two-abstract.html).

You may also find the following general advice on writing great
research papers useful:

  2. [How to write a great research paper]({{ site.baseurl
