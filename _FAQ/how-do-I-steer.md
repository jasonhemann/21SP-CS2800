title: How do I "steer" ACL2/ACL2s ? 
---

People have wanted to know how to steer ACL2 more precisely. Often the
best and most useful advice is to try and "proof-sketch" your
conjecture ahead of time, (like a professional) see what lemmata you
need, and so forth. 

In terms of the mechanics of reading through an ACL2 log, my advice is:
  
  1. [Don't panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic)
  2. [I have linked you to some nice walk-through documentation of what to /do/ with a log]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/CAR-section-4.pdf)
  3. The ACL2 website also has a nice [interactive tutorial](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/flying-demo/script.html#slide3).
  4. You might also see [Pete's chapter on the subject.](https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/~pete/courses/Logic-and-Computation/2021-Spring/rapsteering.pdf)

But my advice is strongly to work with rewrite rules and inductive
proofs. Those are methods of reasoning that I understand and ways that
I know to use the tool, and I avoid the esoteric until it becomes
necessary.
