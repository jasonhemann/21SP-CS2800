title: Why do you emphasize writing here? 
---

I emphasize writing in this course for several reasons.

Firstly, proof has a social component to it. Proving something alone
is not enough to be useful. Experts must disseminate that information
in ways that other experts, as well as the intended audience, can make
use. Much of the benefit of certified-correct software is that we
*know* in such critical applications, that it *is* correct.

Secondly, writing is critical to capably and effectively communicating
your ideas. Even, and in my experience *especially* in a STEM field,
is precision in language important. Exophoric references and an
overabundance of pronouns can frustrate your reader and perhaps lead
him to make a catastrophic error. 

Thirdly, clear writing is highly correlated with clear thinking. The
sense of frustration, when writing, at being forced to state
explicitly and precisely what had been perfectly sufficient gauzy or
muddled thoughts is a relative of the Rubber Duck debugging method.

For more on the importance of writing clearly even in STEM fields, I
suggest [this
