If you want another sample report document on which to model your own,
I link here to [an exemplary model report]({{
site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/Back_to_Basics_Solving_w_SAT.PDF) that I
think you could mirror.

This is just another suggestion; you have at this point already read
[the following article/blog post](https://research.swtch.com/boolean)
on Minimal Boolean Formulas.
