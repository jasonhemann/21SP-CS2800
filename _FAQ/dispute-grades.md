title: How should I dispute or disagree with a grade I received?
---

As a first step, please do reach out to your grader. Our best and
recommended practice is to [email your grader, and write in that email
that you plan to speak with that person at the next office hours they
hold]({{ site.baseurl
}}/office-hours/#office-hours-times-and-formats), and point directly
to the portion of the assignment that you want to discuss. We have a
crackerjack staff, and they are not just here to stick numbers on your
work, but also for discussion and constructive criticism. It can be
instructive to have an informed conversation with someone who's looked
both at your code in particular and that of other students as
well. This is often an excellent opportunity for that kind of
discussion.

If you cannot make that person's office hours, then you should try to
find an alternate time to meet and have this discussion. 

If, after this meeting you still have questions, then please forward
me the email chain in which you have been communicating with your
grader, with the upshot of your prior discussions. 

And of course, if you feel that /I/ haven't given adequate
consideration to your situation or are otherwise unsatisfied, you
should of course raise your concerns with the [Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education and
Experience](http://google.com/search?q=Associate+Dean+of+Undergraduate+Education+and+Experience+site:khoury.northeastern.edu&btnI)
at Khoury.
