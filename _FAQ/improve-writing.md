title: Where can I improve my (technical) writing products?
---

I love this question in part because Northeastern offers a *terrific*
answer! The Northeastern Writing Center offers a [whole *bevy* of
resources](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/writing-resources/),
including some of them tailored *specifically* for writing in STEM fields. 

They actually offer
[appointments](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/tutoring/online-appointments/),
[online](https://neu.mywconline.com/), where a writing specialist will
go over your work with you, and help suggest changes and directions
for improvement. You can do this from the comfort of your pyjamas! How
great is that!?

You can also use one of a number of great tools for linting your
prose. One of the easiest to use is this browser app
[Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) that lints for issues and
color codes them for you.
