title: I missed, due to internet, timing, microphone, a poll. How can I make it up?

These are intentionally short-term, small, and un-make-uppable. These
are our functional analogues of an attendance, as well as feedback for
the instructor on how understanding is going. They lose their use in
one or both of these respects if we take after-the-fact answers,
esp. if we've then gone over the answer (on interesting questions) in
class. With the technology, we don't /have/ a way to do these in an
asynchronous or offline fashion. When it makes sense and when
possible, I have been opening polls ~5m early before the beginning of
class, to let people address any newly-developed technical limitations
or glitches. If on the other hand it seems like we failed to /record/
you answers, then [this is another case]({{
site.baseurl}}/FAQ/poll-questions/).
