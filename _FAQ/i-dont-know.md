title: I'm not sure what the answer to my project is, or even super clear about the question. That's bad, right?

Just, by the way.

We are _doing_ some exploration of questions to which no one we've
ever seen has demonstrated an answer. Right? So if you don't know
exactly how to solve, or even perfectly clearly how to crystal-clearly
*formulate* the question as you work, that's as it should be. It would
be weird if, before being the first ones to solve this question, you
were already the only people on the planet who knew the answer. 

Most importantly, try and see me when you first hit even a
small-to-medium sized wall. If we can get you un-stuck within a short
period of time, then you all can be back off doing your thing and
we're back in parallel. It'd be a shame if you were blocking on just
not wanting to be a bother, or something like that.
