HW 7a: Undecidability Results

|#


#| PART I: A READING ASSIGNMENT ABOUT BIG NUMBERS |# 				       

;; This is a reading assignment. You will have to read, and be
;; prepared to discuss, the following article:
				       
;; https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html
				       
;; You will (likely) have an in-class discussion based on this. So you
;; should absolutely expect to have this understanding checked and
;; verified.
				       
;; If they come up, you should also be prepared to answer some
;; questions individually about this article. You do not need to write
;; anything here, however.

	
#|  Part II: DIAGONALIZATION |# 

;; 1. Using a diagonalization argument as described in section 5.4.2
;; and used in 5.4.2 and 5.4.4, demonstrate the nondenumerability of
;; the real numbers 0 <= r <= 1. Hint: you might find this especially
;; elegant if you work in base 2. Like the examples from the book,
;; this should look much closer to an "informal proof" from a math
;; class than to an ACL2 or pen-and-paper proof.

#| Part III: Undecidability of the Busy Beaver Problem. |# 

;; You have now seen and understood proofs of the undecidability of
;; the halting problem. You have encountered this at minimum in the
;; course textbook, in the "Scooping ..." reading and as discussed in
;; lecture.

;; You have also now read and understood a great deal of the proof and
;; history of the busy beaver problem. You should be able to argue its
;; undecidability, via an informal proof. In fact, I don't think you
;; would find that challenging at all.

;; So, for a little added flavor, you will express a proof of the
;; undecidabliity of the busy beaver problem in Seussian rhyme, a la
;; "Scooping." Provide your answer below. You may use slant rhymes if
;; you need, or regional accents if you must (e.g. "data"/"later").

;; Please follow your Seussian proof with an explanation of it in
;; plain English prose. Where not immediately, transparently obvious
;; point us to what each piece is accomplishing. This should take you
;; several stanzas---approximately the same length as "Scooping ...".

;; Consider: if you do this well, you too could get your proof
;; published!!
