;; The Church-Rosser Theorem in an ACL2-ish prover

;; At the URL
;; https://libkey.io/libraries/545/articles/15438718/full-text-file?utm_source=api_57
;; (reached from NEU via
;; https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/permalink/f/t09un1/TN_cdi_gale_infotracacademiconefile_A6895045)
;; you will find a JACM paper describing a mechanized proof of the
;; Church-Rosser theorem.

;; You do not have to read this in its entirety, or even most of it.

;; You do not have to limit your reading to this paper; in fact there
;; are scores of better places to start learning about the material
;; foundational to understanding this paper.

;; But I want you to _see_ a non-trivial ACL2(-like) proof, and a
;; published work about it.

;; 1. What is the Church-Rosser theorem? Give it to me in about a
;; paragraph. Assume Statement 3.1 is completely incomprehensible to
;; me, but assume further that I'd understand it if I started at the
;; beginning of the paper and methodically worked my way there.

;; 2. Skim pages 508-522. Find some a theorem or definition in there
;; that seems approachable given what you have learned from ACL2S and
;; 2800, and explain what you think it's doing. If you can explain
;; *where* it shows up in the context of the overall proof, that's
;; even better, but I'm not even requiring that.

#| Part II Project Start-up |# 

#| 

This part of your homework this week will /be/ to come up with your
project proposal/suggestion. You should first read all of the prose
and descriptions for what we're looking for, how we'll assess you at
each stage of this exercise, the due dates for each deliverable, and
look to the schedule for upcoming lectures that may be on topic. After
considering the above, looking and exploring, you should write, here,
below this prose, a two to three paragraph statement including:

- in which of the two general topic areas you intend to work*,

- explain the general background(either the ACL2 code, or
  game/artifact/situation otherwise) that you want to investigate,

- precisely what you want to show, 

- that your initial searches revealed no prior art answering this
  question (if you're unclear, explain how yours will differ from
  existing works)

- how you (think you) know that this project is in scope.

;; Together as a group (if you have one) you will make a 15m
;; appointment to meet with either Josh, Ankit, Drew, or me the week
;; of the 22nd-27th of March. I will make myself available at some
;; extra times for people to book appointments; the others you can try
;; to meet during office hours. You will meet with us, and we will
;; work with you on these, to hopefully make sure you have come up
;; with an adequate topic and are set out to explore how to proceed.

;; We will, however, assess this written document that you submit as a
;; stand-alone entry, for both content and grammar/spelling. We will
;; consider this dually here for completion as a part of your
;; homework, and also assess it for quality (as described above) and
;; for meeting the requirements laid out as a part of your overall
;; project grade.

;; * Or if your topic is one of the "none of the above/alternate"
;; options we discussed: that can work too!
