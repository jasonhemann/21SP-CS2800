### Projects 


### SAT

### One kind of project

### NB: What you are /not/ implementing

You would not be implementing a SAT solver. Please. There are plenty
of world-class implementations that are *suuupper* duper fast that
have already been implemented.

Yours would suck by comparison.

You are implementing, if you will, a Sudoku solver. Or an 0h-h1
solver. Specifically, you implement it by implementing a reduction.


### Extended Example.
