## Notes: 

### A better miniKanren

```
#lang racket
;; (require minikanren) -- remove this line, don't use this one
(require minikanren-ee) ;; download install and use this
```

### Some grades not being up to right %

Thank you to Connor for mentioning this. Working on it. 

### Project description discussion

Thank you to Julia for adding to this discussion.

#### Additional notes and points that came up:

If you want to use a pre-blessed format, you can use the ACMART format, in either LaTeX or Word templates: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

If you don't know how to construct a README, then you should look at a list of them to learn from: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

You should actually use [The Craft of Scientific
Writing](https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/permalink/f/365rt0/NEU_ALMA51327615270001401). Check
out the e-book from the NEU library. This matches up with the [guidelines and
references](http://writing.engr.psu.edu/checklists/proposal.html) we mention, page number for page number. 

### I have adjusted schedule to reflect today:
