# Induction like a pro: not so hard! 

  What's the difference? 
  
  The order in which you approach

  1. Wishlist in a queue-like discipline
  2. Bigger steps
    (not so big that you jump over an inductive proof)

## "Yak Shave"

 Yak shave: When you build up an inordinate blocking chain dependencies.

## Induction like a pro. Battle plan.

## Top-down proof design. 

  We have so far been able to get there by building up. Let's figure
  it out as we go.
