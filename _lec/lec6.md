# Brief History of Logic

  300-400 BC: A fascinating time. 

  Greeks. Wanted ways to know when something _had_ to be
  true. Sophists and smooth talkers. Persuasive. When it had to be
  true as a consequence of the things we already take to be
  true. Forms of argumentation.

  Heraclitus "Everything is in motion", "you cannot step into the same
  stream twice."

  Parmenides "Everything is constant, unchanging, eternal"

  Plato gives us, in the allegory of the cave, the fusion of these two ideas. 

  The things we see are echos, shadows of the platonic ideal.


# Euclid's geometry. 

  From basic principles, we can deduce more complicated facts. 
  These are the things that follow from others, analytically.
  
  whereas synthetics are the things we induce from experience. 

# Aristotle's logic. Part-whole logic. 
  
  Lots more, fascinating story. How we get from Aristotle, through the
  scholastics, through the renaissance and 16th and 17th century
  mathematics. 

# Boolean logic, algebraization. Propositional. 

  Stop off with Boolean logic. George Boole. American.

  The logic of propositions. Sentences. 

##  Determine the values of complicated expressions based on the values of smaller expressions. 
  
##  We can determine the meaning of the whole with the values of the immediately smaller sub-pieces. 
  
## Implication.
 
   Difficult and frustrating at times, for students. B/c the way we
   use implication here isn't the way you would normally use it.

  Truth tables. 

```
  | A  | B  | B => A | A => (B => A) |
  | tt | tt | tt     | tt            |
  | ff | tt | ff     | tt            |
  | tt | ff | tt     | tt            |
  | ff | ff | tt     | tt            |
```

   ```
    NOT     !

    AND     &
    OR      v

    IMPLIES =>

    EQUIV   ==
    XOR     ><
