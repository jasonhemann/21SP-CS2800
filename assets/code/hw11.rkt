This week we've begun our discussion of relational programming using
miniKanren.  Before you start the assignment, make sure you have
installed faster-minikanren. If you have, then the above should be
hunky dory.

To familiarize yourself with miniKanren, you should review the
commands from the REPL posted to the course website and your notes
from class.

;; Part I

;; Write the answers to the following problems using your knowledge of
;; miniKanren. For each problem, explain how miniKanren arrived at the
;; answer. You will be graded on the quality of your explanation; a
;; full explanation will require several sentences.

;; 1 What is the value of 

(run 2 (q)
  (== 'cat q)
  (conde
    [(conde 
      [(== 'cat q)
       (== 'horse q)])
     (== 'cat q)]
    [(== q 'cat)]))

;; 2 What is the value of

(run 1 (q) 
  (fresh (a b) 
    (== `(,a ,b) q)
    (absento 'tag q)
    (symbolo a)))

;; 3 What do the following miniKanren constraints mean?

;; a. ==

;; b. =/=

;; c. absento

;; d. numbero

;; e. symbolo

;; Part II

;; Here are our versions of the Racket procedures ''stutter'',
;; ''reverse'', and ''assoc'':

#| 

(define (stutter ls)
  (match ls
    [`() '()]
    [`(,a . ,d)
     (let [(res (stutter d))]
       `(,a ,a . ,res))]))

;; Unlike Racket's built in version, our version of assoc does not
;; have a case for when x is absent from the list. How might this be
;; advantageous when we move to relational versions?

(define (assoc x ls)
  (match ls
    [`((,a . ,ad) . ,d)
     (cond
       [(equal? a x) `(,a . ,ad)]
       [(not (equal? a x)) (assoc x d)])]))

(define (reverse ls)
  (match ls
    [`() '()]
    [`(,a . ,d)
     (let [(res (reverse d))]
       (append res `(,a)))]))

;; Take ''assoc'', ''reverse'', and ''stutter'', and translate them
;; into the equivalent miniKanren relations (''assoco'', and
;; ''reverseo'', ''stuttero'') and put them here.

;; Remember that you may need to rearrange some of the goals in your
;; relations to ensure termination (and therefore to pass the
;; tests). In general, recursive calls should come at the end of a
;; sequence of goals, while explicit or implicit calls to ''==''
;; should come at the beginning.













;; The below tests are a guide. Your relations might not pass these
;; tests as such----listing goals in a different order may cause the
;; stream to return results in a different order. So it is possible
;; that your code is correct though the tests fail.

;; If you suspect this is the case, you could use some of the other
;; rackunit functionality to ensure, say, that all our answers are
;; found within in a slightly longer list of answers that your
;; relation produces
