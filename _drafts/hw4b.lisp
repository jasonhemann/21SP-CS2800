4b is continuates of what you studied in 4a earlier this
week. Therefore, you may find it of considerable interest to complete
4a first, and then return to this afterward. Don't sleep on this one,
though.

PART I: PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC BASICS
===============================================================================

For each of the following Boolean formulas:

A. Construct the truth table. Create a column for each of the
   forumula's subexpressions. List the formulas' variables in the
   leftmost columns, and list those variables in alphabetical order.

B. Indicate if the formula is (a) valid, (b) unsatisfiable, or (c)
   both satisfiable and falsifiable. 

B2. If you chose (c) also indicate how many assignments satisfy the
   formula.

C. Answer, with "yes" or "no": "Is this a minimal formula for these
   assignments?" Here "a minimal formula" means that no
   propositionally equivalent formula has fewer subformulae. 

C2. If you chose "no", demonstrate this by finding an equivalent
   minimal formula and constructing a truth table for your new
   formula. The final columns of the old and new formulae should be
   identical. If you wind up simplifying away a variable, include it
   in the truth table anyway so that you can compare the new truth
   table with the previous one.

C3. If you chose "no", write a TEST? expression stating that the
   original formula and your new formula are equivalent. This should
   *not* be in a comment. ACL2s includes a decision procedure for
   validity, so you can use it as a SAT/validity solver to check your
   work. (For example, you can use it to check your characterization
   of formulas in part B, above.) Use the ACL2s logical operators for
   your expressions.

 (If you want to also automate the checks for the number of
  subformulae, you would operate over *our* expression language, and
  use `valof` from lec5.lisp, or implement a translator between our
  language and acl2s logic expressions, and show a theorem about how
  they behave wrt one another. We will not do this.)

   Please refer to your 4a for a worked-out example.

PART II: IN WE RECOGNIZE THE LION BY HIS CLAUSE
===============================================================================

We know that it can be quite complicated to find satisfying
assignments for boolean formulae, or even to know if one exists. In
fact, the boolean satisfiability problem is NP-Complete. This places
it with the hardest of the hard problems in NP. So, we will set our
sights a little lower. We will restrict ourselves to a particular form
of boolean formulae and study if that helps.

We will study here propositional formulae in a form called HSF. HSF
formulae are a special instance of formulae in CNF. The HSF formulae
are, like CNF formulae, a conjunction of disjunctions of literals. In
HSF, each sequence of disjunctions (a sequence of disjunctions is
called a "clause") has at *most* one positive literal (i.e. at *most*
one non-negated propositional variable.) Notice this simplification
removes the boolean constants for truth and falsity themselves.

;; The following are clauses:
|#

'((! C) v A v (! B) v (! D))
'((! C) v (! B) v (! D))
'((! B) v (! D) v (! C))
'((! D) v C)
'(C)

#|

We can simplify the format even more. Since it's logically equivalent,
we will arrange the clause so we list the positive literal at the end,
if the clause contains a positive literal. In fact, for those with a
positive literal, we will write them as implications. A conjunction of
atoms imply one more. E.g., the implication B ^ C ^ D -> A for the
first clause above. 

|#

;; 4. (Offer an explanation, in terms of our propositional
;; equivalences, why or how this transformation is logically sound.)

#| 

We will, in fact, go a step or two farther. We will instead write our
implications, (and our arrows) backwards! In this syntax, Accessing
the positive literal is simply taking the CAR. 

Since the "antecedents" of these implications are always a sequence of
conjunctions, we shall elide writing out the '&'s and the
parentheses. We will just hold the antecedents in a list. But you and
I will know that the '&'s are there. 

This merely syntactic simplification doesn't make the problem easier,
it just makes our lives easier.

Here is the result of the transformation for 3 of the clauses above.

|#

'(A <= (B C D))
'(C <= (D))
'(C <= ())


#| 

We will simplify further still! Since all clauses *without* a positive
literal are all disjunctions of negations, we don't need to write out
the disjunctions. And in fact, we don't *need* to write out the
negations. As long as we promise to keep track of which kind of clause
is which.

|# 

'(C B D)
'(B D C)

#| 

Further, since all formulae in HSF are conjunctions of HCs, we will
likewise omit writing the '&'s between the clauses. And we will list
separately the clauses with a positive literal and those without. Once
again, this bit of notational housekeeping is just for our piece of
mind.

|# 

'((A <= (B C D))
  (C <= ())
  (C <= (D)))

'((C B D)
  (B D C))

#| 

One final bit of housekeeping to simplify our lives, that you may or
may not have already noticed. We will require that our lists of
clauses, and the lists of negative literals in each clause, are listed
in sorted order, and unique. That is to say, we represent them as
ordered sets.

|#

'((B C D))

;; 4. Your task: implement an efficient (polynomial time) algorithm
;; SATP for deciding the satisfiability of an HSF sentence in our
;; format.


#|

First, let us heavily suggest making use of [the SET library,
implemented with ordered
sets](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ACL2____STD_F2OSETS).

Secondly, although we do not intend to spoil your fun and excitement
from learning, let us heavily suggest that you digest and entertain
one or both of the algorithms described in [this
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743106684900141).

Third, a hint: Sometimes you might need to write a predicate in order
to describe the desired input as an input contract.

Project Proposal 
===============================================================================

This section is not a part of this assignment. This section is not due
with this assignment. It's not numbered since this is not a part of
this assignment. In fact you should not turn it in with this
assignment. I'm including it here because you should start working on
it as you begin working on this assignment. If you /treat/ it like a
part of this assignment, then you'll be well on your way to having
something in good shape. You will get a separate dropbox for it. You
will submit this as a PDF to that Dropbox on Wednesday Oct 14, with
the actual project due Monday Nov 2.

We have already seen how useful boolean formulae can be in modelling
many problems in computer science. We have read about (though maybe
not in full detail) how avionics problems can be rendered with boolean
constraints. We have seen also that there are
theoretically-interesting open questions in these areas, and armed
with what we now know some of these are pretty approachable.

This is a relatively open-ended exercise.  Your pair/mob should write
together a proposal suggesting a small project in the general area of
satisfiability, SAT solving, and or propositional logic.

I would like you to / you should think about something exploratory. I
will expect your project to have a source-code component, and you will
have to have some explanation of your results and contextualization of
the upshot. 

You should have one or two levels to your project proposal. That way,
should something make the larger part infeasible, you can still fall
back on and complete a smaller scale portiono and maybe pivot some
from there.

One category might be to encode some particular problem (probably
something relevant to a class you have taken) as a SAT problem, and
figure out how to run that in a modern, capable SAT solver.

You might want to see how ACL2s compares against one of the [SAT
Olympians](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/flog2018/) on some
interesting benchmark problem instances. (BTW I am sorry to tell you
that you have already missed the [2020 SAT
Competition](http://www.satcompetition.org/).)

Is there a design recipe for encoding problems convenient for SAT
solvers? Could there be? What would it look like, or, if not, what
went wrong when you tried?

You can likely pick an area of computer science that is of interest to
you, and see how SAT solving is applied in that area. Again there
should be some source code component, but what and how much can vary.

You might just be interested in learning more about the basics of
[computational complexity
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)). Maybe you want
to write up a instructional tutorial geared toward someone who has
taken 1800 and 2500, and is just in the middle of OOD. 

Is there already an accessible literate implementation of the DPLL
algorithm? Would it make sense in a purely functional language based
on persistent data structures?

That DIMACS format that was described in the reading, and that came up
in a question in class, is used as a general input format. I didn't
know about it! So there's likely something that's worth talking about
or telling us about!

These are some ideas that came to mind. You just read an article about
other kinds of questions related to boolean formulae, and you might
have some ideas of your own.

Each pair/mob will submit a two to three-page written project
proposal. These are short because they are intended to be
chock-a-block, and cut directly to the heart of the matter. You can
try to cut out fluff or filler words / sentences. Anything for which
the converse is obviously false. The proposals should include enough
detail to convince the reader that you've found a good problem, you
understand how hard it is, you've mapped out a plan for how to attack
it, and you have an idea about which experiments you might run to test
the success of your implementation. Please do not be vague in your
written descriptions. I am going to use your proposal as a way to both
frame a back-and-forth discussion with you, to try and make sure you
are sufficiently challenged but not over your heads, and also to talk
through suggestions about other ideas or places you might look. Also,
do not hesitate to reach out; your proposal document does not have to
be the first time we hear about your idea.

The following is a brief template you might consider:

General problem area
  What are you going to do?
  Why should your reader be interested?
Approach
  What are the traditional approaches?
  What approach are you going to take?
  Why do you think it will work better?
  What small experiments gave you confidence?
Methodology 
  What SPECIFIC steps will you take?
  Which of these steps are particularly hard?
  What will you do if the hard steps don't work out?
Metrics
  How will you know you are done?
  How will you measure success?
Summary
  What will you learn by doing this project?

Adjust this as neccessary based on the scope or focus of your project
and project area. Your proposal is intended to instill confidence in
the reader, and also to help you frame your own thoughts. You should
already have some early evidence of initial success. 

I ask that you follow these general guidelines of a small
proposal. Beyond merely content, we will also judge your prose itself
as scientific writing. Consider, faute de mieux, the [following
guidelines and
references](http://writing.engr.psu.edu/checklists/proposal.html) as a
general outline for non-content criteria we will consider.
