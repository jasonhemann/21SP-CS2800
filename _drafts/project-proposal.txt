Project Proposal 
===============================================================================

This section is not a part of this assignment. This section is not due
with this assignment. It's not numbered since this is not a part of
this assignment. In fact you should not turn it in with this
assignment. I'm including it here because you should start working on
it as you begin working on this assignment. If you /treat/ it like a
part of this assignment, then you'll be well on your way to having
something in good shape. You will get a separate dropbox for it. You
will submit this as a PDF to that Dropbox on Wednesday Oct 14, with
the actual project due Monday Nov 2.

We have already seen how useful boolean formulae can be in modelling
many problems in computer science. We have read about (though maybe
not in full detail) how avionics problems can be rendered with boolean
constraints. We have seen also that there are
theoretically-interesting open questions in these areas, and armed
with what we now know some of these are pretty approachable.

This is a relatively open-ended exercise.  Your pair/mob should write
together a proposal suggesting a small project in the general area of
satisfiability, SAT solving, and or propositional logic.

I would like you to / you should think about something exploratory. I
will expect your project to have a source-code component, and you will
have to have some explanation of your results and contextualization of
the upshot. 

You should have one or two levels to your project proposal. That way,
should something make the larger part infeasible, you can still fall
back on and complete a smaller scale portiono and maybe pivot some
from there.

One category might be to encode some particular problem (probably
something relevant to a class you have taken) as a SAT problem, and
figure out how to run that in a modern, capable SAT solver.

You might want to see how ACL2s compares against one of the [SAT
Olympians](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/flog2018/) on some
interesting benchmark problem instances. (BTW I am sorry to tell you
that you have already missed the [2020 SAT
Competition](http://www.satcompetition.org/).)

Is there a design recipe for encoding problems convenient for SAT
solvers? Could there be? What would it look like, or, if not, what
went wrong when you tried?

You can likely pick an area of computer science that is of interest to
you, and see how SAT solving is applied in that area. Again there
should be some source code component, but what and how much can vary.

You might just be interested in learning more about the basics of
[computational complexity
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)). Maybe you want
to write up a instructional tutorial geared toward someone who has
taken 1800 and 2500, and is just in the middle of OOD. 

Is there already an accessible literate implementation of the DPLL
algorithm? Would it make sense in a purely functional language based
on persistent data structures?

That DIMACS format that was described in the reading, and that came up
in a question in class, is used as a general input format. I didn't
know about it! So there's likely something that's worth talking about
or telling us about!

These are some ideas that came to mind. You just read an article about
other kinds of questions related to boolean formulae, and you might
have some ideas of your own.

Each pair/mob will submit a two to three-page written project
proposal. These are short because they are intended to be
chock-a-block, and cut directly to the heart of the matter. You can
try to cut out fluff or filler words / sentences. Anything for which
the converse is obviously false. The proposals should include enough
detail to convince the reader that you've found a good problem, you
understand how hard it is, you've mapped out a plan for how to attack
it, and you have an idea about which experiments you might run to test
the success of your implementation. Please do not be vague in your
written descriptions. I am going to use your proposal as a way to both
frame a back-and-forth discussion with you, to try and make sure you
are sufficiently challenged but not over your heads, and also to talk
through suggestions about other ideas or places you might look. Also,
do not hesitate to reach out; your proposal document does not have to
be the first time we hear about your idea.

The following is a brief template you might consider:

General problem area
  What are you going to do?
  Why should your reader be interested?
Approach
  What are the traditional approaches?
  What approach are you going to take?
  Why do you think it will work better?
  What small experiments gave you confidence?
Methodology 
  What SPECIFIC steps will you take?
  Which of these steps are particularly hard?
  What will you do if the hard steps don't work out?
Metrics
  How will you know you are done?
  How will you measure success?
Summary
  What will you learn by doing this project?

Adjust this as neccessary based on the scope or focus of your project
and project area. Your proposal is intended to instill confidence in
the reader, and also to help you frame your own thoughts. You should
already have some early evidence of initial success. 

I ask that you follow these general guidelines of a small
proposal. Beyond merely content, we will also judge your prose itself
as scientific writing. Consider, faute de mieux, the [following
guidelines and
references](http://writing.engr.psu.edu/checklists/proposal.html) as a
general outline for non-content criteria we will consider.
